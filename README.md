# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Ryan.

A dedicated programmer who spends his days coding and debugging for a major tech company. I've found my passion for programming and software development, and constantly striving to improve my skills and take on new and challenging projects. In my free time, I continue to study and pick-up new technologies and new ways to tackle the daily challenges of being a programmer.  I unwind by playing video games and reading books. 

Reach out and let's build stuffs!
